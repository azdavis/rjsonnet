# Jsonnet

[Jsonnet][] support for VS Code.

## Warning

This project is a very minimal MVP. Most IDE features are not implemented. Some **language** features haven't even been implemented. There are a lot of TODOs and probably a good amount of latent bugs.

For more mature alternatives, consider:

- [Jsonnet LSP][carl] by Carl Verge
- [Jsonnet Language Server][grafana] by Grafana

## Features

- Inline diagnostics
